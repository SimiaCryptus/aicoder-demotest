      <aside class="notes">
        Large Language Models offer several advantages for coding assistance.
        They are always available and scalable, excel at summarizing and translating code, and can recognize patterns to fix errors.
        They engage in dialog, answer questions, and use inference and few-shot learning.
        Their fuzzy logic helps handle ambiguous information.
        These capabilities make Large Language Models versatile tools for various coding tasks.
      </aside>

      <h2>LLMs are Bad at:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Understanding context <span class="highlight">outside of training data</span></li>
        <li>Generating <span class="highlight">creative or novel</span> content</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Deterministic logic</span> and reasoning</li>
        <li>Handling <span class="highlight">ambiguous instructions</span></li>
        <li>Maintaining <span class="highlight">consistent behavior</span> over long interactions</li>
      </ul>
      <aside class="notes">
        It is crucial to understand the limitations of Large Language Models.
        They struggle with context beyond their training data, potentially leading to outdated information.
        While they can combine ideas, generating truly novel content is challenging.
        Large Language Models often falter with deterministic logic, which is vital in programming.
        They can misinterpret ambiguous instructions, resulting in unexpected outputs.
        During extended interactions, they may have difficulty maintaining consistency or recalling earlier context.
        Recognizing these limitations allows us to use Large Language Models more effectively and identify when human intervention is necessary.

          Iterative Auto-fixing is a powerful feature for debugging and maintaining code.
          It runs system commands like build or test scripts and automatically fixes issues, saving hours of manual debugging.
          You can customize command execution and specify the working directory to fit your workflow.
          The feature uses intelligent error handling based on exit codes for nuanced responses.
          Essentially, it's Artificial Intelligence-driven problem-solving for your development process, automatically identifying and fixing issues,
          which can greatly streamline development, especially for large or complex projects.

          <li><span class="highlight">Apply Patch:</span> Salvage a diff produced in chat</li>
          <li><span class="highlight">"Do Something":</span> Natural language-based code changes</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          Let's explore two powerful ways to make code changes with our Artificial Intelligence Coding Assistant.
          The Apply Patch feature lets you salvage and apply diffs produced in chat, useful for implementing discussed changes directly.
          The "Do Something" action allows you to describe code changes in natural language, which the AI then interprets and implements.
          These features efficiently bridge the gap between discussion and implementation, quickly translating ideas into code changes.

        <h3>Apply Patch Example</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Sometimes an LLM response isn't correctly linked to a file or is not recognized</li>
          <li>The "Apply Patch" allows you to cut and paste the diff and apply it to a file</li>
          <li>This uses the same "fuzzy" patching logic used elsewhere to handle LLM diffs</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          The Apply Patch feature addresses situations where an LLM response isn't correctly linked to a file or recognized by the system,
          which can happen due to the flexible nature of Artificial Intelligence generated content.
          It allows you to manually cut and paste the diff and apply it to a file of your choice, giving you more control over changes.
          The feature uses "fuzzy" patching logic, making it robust enough to handle slight inconsistencies in diff formats.
          This ensures that even if automatic linking fails, you can still easily apply AI-suggested changes to your code, maintaining a smooth workflow.

        <h3>"Do Something" Action</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Code modifications using a 2-step agent with access to the entire project</li>
          <li>Artificial Intelligence interprets, plans simple tasks, and applies changes to codebase</li>
          <li>Useful for quick fixes and moderately complex tasks</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          The "Do Something" action is a powerful feature that leverages a two-step Artificial Intelligence agent with full project access.
          This agent interprets your request, plans the necessary steps, and applies changes directly to your codebase.
          It's particularly effective for quick fixes and moderately complex tasks, allowing you to describe your needs in natural language.
          This feature demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence can enhance software development,
          enabling developers to focus on high-level problem-solving while the Artificial Intelligence manages code implementation details.

      <h2>Troubleshooting Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Adjust temperature setting for creativity/randomness</li>
        <li>Check selected model for task alignment</li>
        <li>Provide clear, specific instructions</li>
        <li>Look at actual requests/responses</li>
        <li>Provide an example of your desired output</li>
      </ul>
      <aside class="notes">
        To optimize your experience with the Artificial Intelligence Coding Assistant, consider these troubleshooting tips:
        Adjust the temperature setting to control the Artificial Intelligence's creativity and randomness.
        Ensure you're using the most appropriate model for your specific task.
        Provide clear and precise instructions to help the Artificial Intelligence understand your intent.
        If results are unexpected, examine the actual requests and responses to gain insight into the Artificial Intelligence's interpretation.
        Offering an example of your desired output can significantly improve results.
        Remember that working with Artificial Intelligence is a skill that improves with practice,
        so don't hesitate to experiment and refine your approach to find what works best for your projects.
