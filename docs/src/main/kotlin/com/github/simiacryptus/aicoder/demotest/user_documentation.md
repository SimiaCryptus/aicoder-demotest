Click "OK" to proceed after configuring these settings.


#### 3. Using the Web Interface
The system will open a web interface where you can:
1. Enter your task description in the message input field
2. Click the send button to submit your task
3. Monitor the execution progress through multiple stages:
   - Agent iterations showing the planning process
   - Individual task executions within each iteration
   - Thinking status updates


#### 4. Monitoring Progress
The interface provides:
- Multiple tabs showing different agent iterations
- Detailed task breakdowns within each iteration
- A final summary tab with the execution results


#### 5. Controlling Execution
- You can stop the execution at any time using the controls button
- The system will provide a summary of completed tasks
- Results can be reviewed in the interface after completion


### Best Practices
1. Provide clear and specific task descriptions
2. Monitor the execution progress through the interface
3. Review the summary for a complete overview of changes
4. Use the auto-apply feature carefully in production environments


### Troubleshooting
